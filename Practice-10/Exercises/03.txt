The following function supposedly computers the sum and average of the numbers in the
array a, which has length n, avg and sum point to variables that the functions should
modify. Unfortunately, the function contains several errors; find and correct them.

void avg_sum(double a[], int n, double *avg, double *sum)
{
    int i;

    sum = 0.0;
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
        sum += a[i];
    avg = sum / n;
}


Corrected function:

void avg_sum(double a[], int n, double *avg, double *sum)
{
    int i;

    *sum = 0.0;
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
        *sum += a[i];
    *avg = *sum / n;
}
