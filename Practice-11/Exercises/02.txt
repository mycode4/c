Suppose that high, low, and middle are all pointer variables of the same type, and that
low and high point to elements of an array. Why is the following statement illegal, and
how could it be fixed?

middle = (low + high) / 2;

The expression low + high is not legal because we cannot add two pointers together.
To get the middle element we can use subtraction: ((high - low) / 2) + low

E.g Low = 23, High = 48;

high - low = 25, / 2 = 12, + low = 35
