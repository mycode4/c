Suppose that a is a one-dimensional array and p is a pointer variable. Assuming that the
assignment p = a has just been performed, which of the following expessions are illegal
because of mismatched types? Of the remaining expressions, which are true (have a nonzero
value)?

(a) p == a[0]  Illegal - &a[0] compared to a[0]
(b) p == &a[0] - Legal - &a[0] compared to &a[0]
(c) *p == a[0] - Legal - *&a[0] (which is equivalent to a[0]) compared to a[0]
(d) p[0] == a[0] Legal - *(p + 0) compared to a[0]

(b), (c) and (d) are true because when p is assigned to a, it points to the first element
in a (a[0]).
