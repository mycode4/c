The following function calls supposedly write a single new-line character, but some are
incorrect. Identify which calls don't work and explain why.

(a) printf("%c", '\n');         (g) putchar('\n');
(b) printf("%c", "\n");         (h) putchar("\n");
(c) printf("%s", '\n');         (i) puts('\n');
(d) printf("%s", "\n");         (j) puts("\n");
(e) printf('\n');               (k) puts(" ");
(f) printf("\n");

Incorrect calls:
(b) printf expects second argument to be of type char to match format specifier %c, second
    argument received is type char *.
(c) printf expects second argument to be of type char * to match format specifier %s, second
    argument received is type char.
(e) printf expects first argument to be type const char *, received type char.
(h) putchar expects type char, received type char *.
(i) puts expects type const char *, received type char.
(j) puts already prints a newline at the end so this statment prints two newline chars.
(k) prints a space and a new line character rather than just a newline char.
