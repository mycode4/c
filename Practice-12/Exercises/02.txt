Suppose that p has been declared as follows:

char *p = "abc";

Which of the following function calls are legal? Show the output produced by each legal
call, and explain why the others are illegal.

(a) putchar(p) - Illegal. putchar function expects one arguments of type int (character).
    This statement provides putchar with a pointer to a char.

(b) putchar(*p) - Legal. putchar function expects one argument of type int (character).
    This statement provides putchar with an int by dereferencing the pointer p, which
    is the characters integer value at position 0 in the string literal. This statement
    will print the character a.

(c) puts(p) - Legal. puts function expects one argument being a pointer to a char.
    p is a pointer to a char and the output printed by puts is abc.

(d) puts(*p) - Illegal. puts function expect one argument being a pointer to a char.
    dereferencing p provides a value of type char, which cannot be passed to the puts
    function.
