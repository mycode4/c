Suppose that we call scanf as follows:

scanf("%d%s%d", &i, s, &j);

If the user enters 12abc34 56def78, what will be the values of i, s, and j after the
call? (Assume that i and j are int variables and s is an array of characters.)

%d will read any number of decimal digits, so the first call of %d will read 12, then it
will encounter the character a which isn't a decimal digit, so it will put it back.
This gives i the value 12.

%s will read any number of non-whitespace characters, so will read abc34, then it will 
encounter the white space character which is put back.
This gives s the value abc34.

%d will ignore that previous whitespace character, and then read any number of decimal
digits. It reads 56, then encounters the character s which is put back.
This gives j the value 56.

i = 12
s = abc34
j = 56
