Suppose that str is an array of characters. Which one of the following statements is not
equivalent to the other three?

(a) *str = 0;
(b) str[0] = '\0'
(c) strcpy(str, "");
(d) strcat(str, "");

Statement d behaves differently to the others because strcat appends a null character to
the end of str, rather than set the first element in str to be the null character which
the other statements perform (strcpy does this because it overwrites the original string
with "").
