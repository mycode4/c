What will be the value of the string s1 after the following statements have been executed?

strcpy(s1, "computer");
strcpy(s2, "science");
if (strcmp(s1, s2) < 0)
    strcat(s1, s2);
else
    strcat(s2, s1);
s1[strlen(s1)-6] = '\0';

after strcmp and strcat: computerscience\0
after s1[strlen(s1)-6] = '\0': strlen(s1) = 15 - 6 = 9, s1[9] = c
s1 is "computers\0" after s1[9] changed to '\0'.
