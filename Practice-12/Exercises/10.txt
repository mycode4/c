The following function supposedly creates an identical copy of a string. What's wrong with
the function?

char *duplicate(const char *p)
{
    char *q;

    strcpy(q, p);
    return q;
}

q has been declared as a pointer to a char, however it has not been initialized
so currently points nowhere in particular. We need to initialize it to point
somewhere that will be large enough to accomodate a copy of the string pointed
to by p includings its nul terminating char.

To return a variable initialized within a function, we also need to make it
static as the storage duration of variables defined within blocks is automatic
by default.
