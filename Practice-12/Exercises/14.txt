What does the following program print?

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    char s[] = "Hsjodi", *p;

    for (p = s; *p; p++)
        --*p;
    puts(s);
    return 0;
}

The program prints: Grinch

--*p first gets the value pointed to by p, the decrements it. This is because the indirection
operator and prefix decrement operator are of the same precedence, and right associative.
