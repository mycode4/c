Describe some advantages and disadvantages of diving a program into multiple source files.

(a) Advantages

    (i) By splitting up a program into multiple source files, we can perform information hiding
        by only listing function prototypes in header files that we want other classes to use.
        This allows us to create functions in source files that are essentially hidden from the
        other source files because their prototype doesn't exist outside the source file.
        This advantage is especially helpful when working in a team as it lets other
        programmers know which functions can be called by other classes.

    (ii)
        Testing/debugging individual source files will be more efficient as you would
        only need to compile a small subset of files when making changes, rather than compiling
        a large file containing many things that you may not need to test at the time.

    (iii)
        Having a single source file that contains tens of thousands of lines can be really
        problematic to search and can even get to a point where text editors and IDE's run
        into issues trying to load so many lines at a time.


(b) Disadvantages

    (i) Small programs that can logically be written in a single file can have unneccessary
        complexity if written in multiple source files for the sake of having multiple
        source files.

    (ii)
        A program split into various source files without adhering to grouping of
        related functionality can cause confusion as the structure wouldn't follow some
        logical reasoning.
