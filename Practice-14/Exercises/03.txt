We saw that writing #include <file> instead of #include "file" may not work if file is
one that we've written. Would there be any problem with writing #include "file" instead of
#include <file> if file is a system header?

The second way will also work, the only difference is that it will search the current
directory for that particular header file before searching the directory in which the
system header files are. 

This can be different though if you have a header file
declared in your working directory that matches a header file in the system header files
directory.

E.g If you defined your own header file as stdbool.h then:

#include "stdbool.h" will include your working directory version of stdbool.h

however writing:

#include <stdbool.h> will include the version residing in the system header files directory.
