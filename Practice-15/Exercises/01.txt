In the following declarations, the x and y structures have members named x and y:

struct { int x, y; } x;
struct { int x, y; } y;

Are these declarations legal on an individual basis? Could both declarations appear as
shown in a program?

Both statements are legal on an individual basis, and together. All the variables declared
within a struct have block scope, meaning the variables x and y inside struct x cannot see
the variables x and y inside struct y. It's also fine for a variable inside a struct to share
the same name as the struct itself, because the only way we can access that variable is by
appending it to the struct name with a period.

So in this example we can access the struct variables via:
struct x:
x.x
x.y

struct y:
y.x
y.y
