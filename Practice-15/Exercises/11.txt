Suppose that s is the following structure:

struct {
    double a;
    union {
        char b[4];
        double c;
        int d;
    } e;
    char f[4];
} s;

If char values occupy one byte, int values occupy four bytes, and double values
occupy eight bytes, how much space will a C compiler allocate for s? (Assume
that the compiler leaves no "holes" between members.)

a = 8 bytes
e = 8 bytes (double largest in union)
f = 4 bytes

Total 20 bytes
