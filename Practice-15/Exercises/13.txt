Suppose that s is the following structure (point is a structure tag declare in
exercise 10):

struct shape {
    int shape_kind;
    struct point center;
    union {
        struct {
            int height, width;
        } rectangle;
        struct {
            int radius;
        } circle;
    } u;
} s;

If the value of shape_kind is RECTANGLE, the height and width members store the
dimensions of a rectangle. If the value of shape_kind is CIRCLE, the radius
member stores the radius of a circle. Indicate which of the following 
statements are legal, and show how to repair the ones that aren't:

(a) s.shape_kind = RECTANGLE;   Legal
(b) s.center.x = 10;            Legal
(c) s.height = 25;              Illegal -> s.u.rectangle.height = 25;
(d) s.u.rectangle.width = 8;    Legal
(e) s.u.circle = 5;             Illegal
    Firstly we should set s.shape_kind to CIRCLE, otherwise we'll be assigning
    a radius to a structure thats supposed to represent a rectangle.
    s.shape_kind = CIRCLE:
    s.u.circle.radius = 5;

(f) s.u.radius = 5;             Illegal -> s.u.circle.radius = 5;
