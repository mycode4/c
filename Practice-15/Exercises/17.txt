Suppose that b and i are declared as follows:

enum {FALSE, TRUE} b;
int i;

Which of the following statements are legal? Which ones are "safe" (always yield
a meaningful result)?

(a) b = FALSE;          Legal & Safe
(b) b = i;              Legal & Unsafe, i could be outside the range of b's values
(c) b++;                Legal & Unsafe, b could be increased outside the range of b's values
(d) i = b;              Legal & Safe
(e) i = 2 * b + 1;      Legal & Safe
