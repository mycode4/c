Suppose that f and p are declared as follows:

struct {
    union {
        char a, b;
        int c;
    } d;
    int e[5];
} f, *p = &f;

Which of the following statements are legal?

(a) p->b = ' '; Illegal. To access b we must use p->d.b = ' ';
(b) p->e[3] = 10;  Legal.
(c) (*p).d.a = '*'; Legal.
(d) p->d->c = 20; Illegal. d isn't a pointer. we must use p->d.c = 20;
