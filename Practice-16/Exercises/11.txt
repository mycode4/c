Write the following function:

int count_occurrences(struct node *list, int n);

The list parameter points to a linked list; the function should return the
number of times n appears in this list. Assume the node structure is the one
defined in section 17.5.

int count_occurrences(struct node *list, int n)
{
    int total = 0;

    while (list) {
        if (list->value == n)
            total++;
        list = list->next;
    }
    return total;
}
