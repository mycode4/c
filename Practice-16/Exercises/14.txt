Modify the delete_from_list function (Section 17.5) so that its first
parameter has tupe struct node ** (a pointer to a pointer to the first node in
a list) and its return type is void. delete_from list must modify its
first argument to point to the list after the desired node has been deleted.

void *delte_from_list(struct node **pp, int n)
{
    struct node *entry = *pp;

    while (entry) {
        if (entry->value == n) {
            *pp = entry->next;
            free(entry);
        }
        pp = &entry->next;
        entry = entry->next;
    }
}
