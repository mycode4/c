Let f be the following function. What will be the value of f(10) if f has
never been called before? What will be the value of f(10) if f has been called
five times previously?

int f(int i)
{
    static int j = 0;
    return i * j++;
}

Value of f(10) (Never called before): 0

Value of f(10) (Called five times before): 50
