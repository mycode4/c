State whether each of the following statements is true or false. Justify each answer.

(a) Every variable with static storage duration has file scope. False
    A static variable declared outside a block has file scope.
    A static variable declared inside a block has block scope, but has
    static duration.

(b) Every variable declared inside a function has no linkage. False
    If a variable is given the storage class 'extern' inside a function then it
    will either have:

    Internal linkage if variable is declared as static earlier in the file.
    (outside of any function.)

    External linkage in all other circumstances.

(c) Every variable with internal linkage has static storage duration. True
    The only way to give a variable internal linkage is by declaring it
    static and this variable must be declared outside of a function.

(d) Every parameter has block scope. True
    Any variable that is declared within a function has block scope which
    cannot be changed. As function parameters are new variables (copies of the
    arguments provided in a function call), they are local to the function.
    The only way for a variable to have file scope is if the variable has been
    defined outside of any function. None of the storage classes change the
    scope of the attached variable.
