The following function is supposed to print an error message. Each message is preceded by
an integer, indicating the number of times the function has been called. Unfortunately, the
function always display 1 as the number of the error message. Locate the error and show how
to fix it without making any changes outside the function.

void print_error(const char *message)
{
    int n = 1;
    printf("Error %d: %s\n", n++, message);
}

The error with the function is that the variable n has automatic storage duration.
As it hasn't been provided with a storage class, and it is local to a function
it is by default given the auto storage class. This means that a new copy of n
is initialized each time the function is called. To fix this error, we need to
change n's storage class to static, so that the variable can be reused for
successive function calls.

void print_error(const char *message)
{
    static int n = 1;
    printf("Error %d: %s\n", n++, message);
}
