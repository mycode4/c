Suppose that we declare x to be a const object. Which one of the following
statements about x is false?

(a) If x is of type int, it can be used as the value of a case label in a which
    statement.
    False. A const variable cannot be used in constant expressions.
    As a switch statement requires a constant expression, we can't use a const int.

(b) The compiler will check that no assignment is made to x.
    True - A const variable is read-only and the compiler will ensure that
    no attempts are made to assign it a new value.

(c) x is subject to the same scope rules as variables.
    True. The only way to change the scope rules of a variable is by changing
    the place in a file in which it is declared, not by changing the type
    qualifier(s) it is given.

(d) x can be of any type.
    True. The type qualifier const doesn't limit the type specifiers that can
    be given to a variable.
