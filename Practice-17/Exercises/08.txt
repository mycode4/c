Write a complete description of the type of x as specified by each of the
following declarations.

(a) char (*x[10])(int);
    x is an
    array with size 10 of
    pointers to
    functions with one int argument
    with the return type char

(b) int (*x(int))[5];
    x is a function
    with one int parameter
    that returns a pointer
    to an array with size 5 of
    integers.


(c) float *(*x(void))(int)
    x is a function
    with no arguments
    that returns a pointer
    to a function with one int argument
    that returns a pointer to a float

(d) void (*x(int, void *y)(int))) (int);
    x is a function
    with two arguments: int and a pointer to a function with one int argument with return type void.
    that returns a pointer to
    a function that takes one int argument
