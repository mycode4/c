(a) Write a complete description of the type of the function f, assuming
    that it's declared as follows:

    int (*f(float (*)(long), char*))(double);

    f is a
    function with two arguments
        first argument being a pointer to a function with a long argument returning a float
        second argument being a pointer to char
    that returns a pointer to
    a function with one double argument
    returning an int.

(b) Give an example showing how f would be called.

    float function1(long n)
    {
        return (float) n + 2.3f;
    }

    int function2(double d)
    {
        return (int) d * 5;
    }

    int (*f(float (*fp)(long), char *p))(double d)
    {
        *p = *p - fp(5);
        return function2;
    }

    int main(void)
    {
        char c = 'A';
        double d = 3.5;

        int n = (f(function1, &c))(d);
        printf("%c, %d\n", c, n);
    }
