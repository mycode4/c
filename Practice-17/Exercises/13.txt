Which of the following declarations are legal? (Assume that PI is a macro that
represents 3.14159.)

(a) char c = 65;                                        Legal.

(b) static int i = 5, j = i * i;                        Illegal.
    static storage duration variables require a constant expression for
    initialization.

(c) double d = 2 * PI;                                  Legal.

(d) double angles[] = {0, PI / 2, PI, 3 * PI / 2};      Legal.
