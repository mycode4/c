Each fo the following macros defines the position of a single bit within
and integer:

#define SHIFT_BIT 1
#define CTRL_BIT 2
#define ALT_BIT 4

The following statement is supposed to test whether any of the three bits have
been set, but it never displays the specified message. Explain why the statement
doesn't work and show how to fix it. Assume that key_code is an int variable.

if (key_code & (SHIFT_BIT | CTRL_BIT | ALT_BIT) == 0)
    printf("No modifier keys pressed\n");

This statement doesn't work because of operator precedence, as the equality
operator has higher precedence than bitwise and, we need to use parentheses as
follows:

if ((key_code & (SHIFT_BIT | CTRL_BIT | ALT_BIT)) == 0)
    printf("No modifier keys pressed\n");

This ensures that we & the two ints first and then compare the result to 0.
