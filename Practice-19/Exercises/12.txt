The following function supposedly combines two bytes to form an unsigned
short integer. Explain why the function doesn't work and show how to fix it.

unsigned short create_short(unsigned char high_byte, unsighed char low_byte)
{
    return high_byte << 8 + low_byte;
}

Again, the problem with this function is caused by operator precedence, The
addition operator has a higher precedence than the bitwise left shift operator,
so we must enclose the bitwise left shift operation in parentheses:

return (high_byte << 8) + low_byte;
