If n is an unsigned int variable, what effect does the following statement
have on the bits in n?

n &= n - 1;

This statement will remove the least significant 1 bit from n.

E.g (Assuming rightmost bit is least significant):
if n is 10110, then after this statement it would be 10100 because:
    10110
      &
    10101
      =
    10100

This is an efficient way of counting the number of 1 bits in a number should it
be used in a loop that terminates when n is 0. The number of iterations will be
dependent on the number of 1 bits, rather than the total number of bits.
