scanf("%d%f%d", &x, &i, &y);

assume i is an int variable and x & y are float variables.

if a user enters:
12.3 45.6 789

the values of i, x and j would be:

x = 12.3 - scanf reads '1', '2', '.' (since x is a float variable scanf continues), '3', ' ' and
'4'. Since '4' is preceded by a white-space character it is put back into the
input string, leaving us with 12.3 to be assigned to x.

45.6 789

i = 45 - scanf reads '4', '5', '.'. Since i is an integer variable, it cannot
contains decimals. The '.' is put back in the input string, and i is assigned
the value 45.

.6 789

y = 0.6 - scanf reads '.' (since x is a float variable scanf continues), '6',
' ', '7'. Since '7' is preceded by a white-space character, it is put back into
the input string. y is give the value .6 (0.6).

789
As no more variables remain to capture the input, 789 can only be accessed with
another scanf call.
