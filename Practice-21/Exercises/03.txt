Find the error in the following program fragment and show how to fix it.

FILE *fp;

if (fp = fopen(filename, "r")) {
    //read characters until end-of-file
}
fclose(fp);


The error is that the program fragment always attempts to close the file
pointed to by fp, however if fopen failed then fp would be a null pointer.
Attempting to call fclose on a null pointer is an error.

Fixed version:

FILE *fp

if (fp = fopen(filename, "r")) {
    //read characters until end-of-file;
}
else {
    printf("Error, cannot open file: %s\n", filename);
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
fclose(fp);
