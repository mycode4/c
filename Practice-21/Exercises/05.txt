Is there any difference between the printf conversion specifications %.4d and
%04d? If so, explain what it is.

These expressions are equivalent.

As the conversion specifier is d, we must be dealing with an int value.
The first expression '%.4d' contains the precision '.4'.
When the precision modifier is applied to an int value, it signifies the minimum
number of digits that must be printed (leading zeros added if the number has
fewer digits).

The second expression '%04d' contains the flag 0 (zero) which means that leading
zeros are padded up to the field width. As the field width is 4, this means
that any integers with 3 digits or fewer will have leading zeros added.
