In previous chapters, we've used the scanf format string " %c" when we wanted to
skip white-space characters and read a nonblank character. Some programmers use
"%1s" instead. Are the two techniques equivalent? If not, what are the
differences?

They are similar but not identical. The difference being that a null character
will be inserted at the end of the char array when %s is used (as strings are
null terminated).
