Which one of the following calls is not a valid way of reading one character
from the standard input stream?

(a) getch()
(b) getchar()
(c) getc(stdin)
(d) fgetc(stdin)

Answer: a
getch() behaves differently than the other three because it doesn't read
from a buffer (so it doesn't read from the stdin input stream), getch() instead
waits for a character to be input when it is called, and then immediately
returns the input character without the user pressing the Enter key.
