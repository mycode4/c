If i and j are positive integers, does (-i)/j always have the same value as -(i/j)?

Answer: Yes

Rules for division
    Pos / Pos = Pos
    Pos / Neg = Neg
    Neg / Pos = Neg
    Neg / Neg = Pos

Whenever one of the values is negative, we can change it to postive by removing the minus, 
carry out the division and then simply put the minus back on the result.

E.g:

    10 / 5 = 2
    10 / -5 = -2
    -10 / 5 = -2
    -10 / -5 = 2
