The if statements are equivalent, the second one just evaluates in reverse

 if statement one:                       if statement two:
 90 to positive infinity: A              negative infinity to 59: F
                80 to 89: B                             60 to 69: D
                70 to 79: C                             70 to 79: C
                60 to 69: D                             80 to 89: B
 negative infinity to 59: F              90 to positive infinity: A
