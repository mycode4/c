What output does the following for statement produce?

for (i = 10; i >= 1; i /= 2)
    printf("%d ", i++);


i = 10, print 10, increment i to 11, divide 11 by 2
i = 5, print 5, increment i to 6, divide 6 by 2
i = 3, print 3, increment i to 4, divide 4 by 2
i = 2, print 2, increment i to 3, divide 3 by 2
i = 1, print 1, increment i to 2, divide 2 by 2
i = 1, print 1, increment i to 2, divide 2 by 2
...Infinite loop!
