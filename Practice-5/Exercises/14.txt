Find the error in the following program fragment and fix it.

if (n % 2 == 0);
    printf("n is even\n");

The problem is the semicolon at the end of the if statement, by placing a semi colon here
we are creating a null statement which ends the if prematurely. This means that the printf
statement isn't inside the if statement and thus will always be executed.
