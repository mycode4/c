If c is a variable of type char, which one of the  following statements is illegal?

(a) i += c; /* i has type int */
(b) c = 2 * c - 1;
(c) putchar(c);
(d) printf(c);

The printf statement in (d) isn't legal.
We can either do:
printf("%f", c); - This prints the character c represents.
printf("%d", c); - This prints the number of the character in the ascii table.
