Suppose that i is a variable of type int, j is a variable of type long, and
k is a variable of type double. What is the type of the expression:
i * f / d?

As double is the largest sized variable used in this operation, the other two
values must be converted to a double so that the operation can be performed.
This means that the expression evaluates to a double value.
