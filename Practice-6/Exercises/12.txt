Suppose that i is a variable of type int, f is a variable of type float, and d is
a variable of type double. Explain what conversions take place during the 
execution of the following statement:
d = i + f

Order of evaluation:
double = (int + float)
double = float
double

As addition has a higher precedence than assignment, the value of i + f is converted
to float. When assingment occurs, the expression on the right side is always converted
to the type of the variable on the left side. This converts the float to a double.
