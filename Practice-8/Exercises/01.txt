The following function contains two errors:

double triangle_area(double base, height)
double product;
{
    product = base * height;
    return product / 2;
}

The first error is that the second parameter 'height' isn't given a type. A
specified type must be given to each parameter, even when they may all have the
same type.

The second error is that the local variable 'product' is not declared within
the function body. All declarations belonging to a function must be written
inside its curly braces.

Corrected function:

double triangle_area(double base, double height)
{
    double product;

    product = base * height;
    return product / 2;
}
