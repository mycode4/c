What will be the output of the following program?

#include <stdio.h>

void swap(int a, int b);

int main(void)
{
    int i = 1, j = 2;

    swap(i, j);
    printf("i = %d, j = %d\n", i, j);
    return 0;
}

void swap (int a, int b)
{
    int temp = a;
    a = b;
    b = temp;
}

We might expect that this simple program swaps the values of two integer variables,
however it doesn't do this because the swap function only swaps copies of the
variables i and j because functions pass parameters by value, rather than reference.
To swap the variables i and j we need to pass two pointers that point to i and j
to the swap function so that they can change them directly.
