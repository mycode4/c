The following function is supposed to return true if any element of the array a
has the value 0 and false if all elements are nonzero. Sadly, it contains an error.
Find the error and show how to fix it:

bool has_zero(int a[], int n)
{
    int i;
    
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
        if (a[i] == 0)
            return true;
        else
            return false;
}

The problem with the function is that it will return true or false after one iteration.
if the first element of a is 0, it returns true, but if the first element is non-zero
it returns false. Instead, we want it to check that ALL elements in the array are
positive before returning false. 
To fix this all we need to do is remove the else clause within the loop,
and place 'return false' after the loop as it could only ever be reached when all
elements are non zero.

Fixed version:

bool has_zero(int a[], int n)
{
    int i;

    for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
        if (a[i] == 0)
            return true; //Will return from the function when a zero element is found

    return false; //Can only be reached if all elements are non zero
}
